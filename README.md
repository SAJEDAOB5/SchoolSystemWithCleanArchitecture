<h1> School Management System</h1>
<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>The School Management System is a robust and scalable application designed to streamline and optimize various aspects of educational institutions. Leveraging the principles of Clean Architecture, the project maintains a modular and maintainable codebase, ensuring flexibility and ease of future development.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<h2>Clean Architecture:</h2>

<p>The project is built upon the Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers to enhance maintainability and testability.</p>
<h2>Entity Relationships:</h2>

<p>Utilizing a many-to-many relationship model, the system effectively manages complex relationships between entities, ensuring a comprehensive representation of data.</p>
<h2>Fluent API and Entity Framework Core:</h2>

<p>The application employs Fluent API in conjunction with Entity Framework Core for database connectivity. This powerful combination ensures efficient data modeling and management.</p>
<h2>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):</h2>

<p>Embracing the CQRS pattern enhances the separation of concerns by segregating the read and write operations, optimizing performance and scalability.</p>
<h2>Dependency Injection:</h2>

<p>Leveraging the Dependency Injection design pattern enhances modularity and facilitates the management of object dependencies, promoting code maintainability and flexibility.</p>
<h2>Generic Repository Design Pattern:</h2>

<p>A generic repository pattern is implemented to provide a consistent and generic interface for data access, promoting code reuse and simplifying the data layer.</p>
<h2>Custom Routing and Inline Middleware:</h2>

<p>The project introduces custom routing and inline middleware to enhance request processing. This allows for the implementation of custom header requests and tailored routing logic.</p>
