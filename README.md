School Management System
Overview:
The School Management System is a robust and scalable application designed to streamline and optimize various aspects of educational institutions. Leveraging the principles of Clean Architecture, the project maintains a modular and maintainable codebase, ensuring flexibility and ease of future development.

Key Features:
Clean Architecture:

The project is built upon the Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers to enhance maintainability and testability.
Entity Relationships:

Utilizing a many-to-many relationship model, the system effectively manages complex relationships between entities, ensuring a comprehensive representation of data.
Fluent API and Entity Framework Core:

The application employs Fluent API in conjunction with Entity Framework Core for database connectivity. This powerful combination ensures efficient data modeling and management.
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

Embracing the CQRS pattern enhances the separation of concerns by segregating the read and write operations, optimizing performance and scalability.
Dependency Injection:

Leveraging the Dependency Injection design pattern enhances modularity and facilitates the management of object dependencies, promoting code maintainability and flexibility.
Generic Repository Design Pattern:

A generic repository pattern is implemented to provide a consistent and generic interface for data access, promoting code reuse and simplifying the data layer.
Custom Routing and Inline Middleware:

The project introduces custom routing and inline middleware to enhance request processing. This allows for the implementation of custom header requests and tailored routing logic.
